# Follow these directions to set up communications between MBP and RPi

For headless RPi without access to router and without USB wifi dongle:
- Connect crossover ethernet cable to ethernet jack on RPi

- Other end of ethernet through USB-ethernet adapter into MBP
- - make sure ethernet adapter extension is working properly
- - - About this mac > system report > Extensions > AX88772 (for Tripplite USB 2.0 device)
- - - Loaded = yes ?

- If RPi doesn't need network connectivity, internet sharing = off
- - In Terminal : arp - a
- - Look for raspberrpi.local on en8 (probably something like 169.254.182.95)
- - - This is a self-assigned IP, will not be able to connect to internet
- - Can SSH using this address. In Terminal:
- - - ping 169.254.182.95 (check to see if packets are sending)
- - - ssh pi@169.254.182.95
- - Then log in

- If RPi needs network connectivity, internet sharing = on
- - *** NB: This will not work on all networks, GTWifi amongst them!
- - In Terminal : arp - a
- - - Look for IP address on bridge100 (could be something like 192.168.3.2)
- - Then follow similar procedure as above to SSH

- If you need screen sharing:
- - RPi must have been configured appropriately in VNC Server beforehand!
- - - See "The best part of using your Mac" answer at https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/59605/access-to-raspberry-pi-vnc-session-from-mac-os-x
- - In Finder > CMD + K > In "server address" field: vnc://<rpi ip address here>
